Moreover, this stretchable fabric offers great recovery as well. Maternity accessories containing spandex fabric (lycra material) (think modal and spandex underwear) tend to be comfortable and lightweight- perfect for gym workouts, yoga and any kind of exercise. Spandex fabric or lycra fabric is also durable and moisture wicking which makes it a very common addition to the fabric composition of most activewear products for yoga and other kinds of workout/exercise during pregnancy or otherwise.",
        "content 18": "Spandex/Lycra:",
        "content 19": "Who doesn’t love a wonderful pair of cotton-anything? Cotton fibre is an excellent option of a plant fibre and it offers excellent breathability and comfort- and oh goodness, the softness. Expecting mummies love cotton because it just feels so good and it is so lightweight. Cotton fabric uses natural fibres and is loved because of its softness, durability and comfort. Pregnant women could wear cotton bottomwear and top wear  the whole day and move as you like as this is also one of the most breathable fabrics especially when compared to more synthetic fabrics like polyester fabric. And when you are pregnant, care for clothing is the last thing you want to worry about - and cotton is super low maintenance!",

        "content 21": "Unsurprisingly also known as underwear fabric, modal is breathable, soft and overall a very stretchable fabric that feels like butter against your skin and this is wonderful during pregnancy. Because of its innate flexibility, it pairs exceptionally well with spandex to provide that added stretch that can enhance your workout experience and keep you comfortable. It has better moisture wicking abilities when compared to cotton and it is also very durable. Maintaining modal is also easier- it is not prone to shrinkage.",

        "content 29": "Spandex fabric works great because it is stretchy but also fits really well. However, do not opt for body fitting clothes such as body con T-shirts or dresses during pregnancy. Even if you are not planning to do any yoga or exercise, you will still want to keep moving comfortably and for this reason tight clothes must be avoided at all costs. The clothes should stretch comfortably over your baby bump, even if they’re not necessarily belly support leggings.",
